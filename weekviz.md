title: Visualizing Relationships and Communication Media

description: For a Mapping and Diagramming project to document some aspect of a week of my life, I wanted to visualize my online and offline interactions and how they connected. Within two weeks, I developed an application to log my offline interactions, and integrated a few APIs with the Raphael.js library to create a vector-based visualization, which I then tweaked in Adobe Illustrator.
