      <p>The new ChemCollective homepage design. Here, the design clarifies the importance of and relationships between information on the page. For example, navigation to access the ChemCollective's resources is centralized in the left hand navigation. On the old site, users would access resources from lists on a few subpages linked to from the homepage.</p>

      <p>Transitioning the ChemCollective site to be database-driven allowed for activities to be automatically organized based on metadata like their type and topic.</p>

      <p>My sketch of a new design for the main work area for the virtual lab. One key change was grouping all of the information about the currently selected chemical in one place, so that it would be simpler to monitor changes.</p>

<div class="project-overview">
  <p>The ChemCollective has provided free online resources for chemistry teachers and students since 2000. During my internship there in 2011, I redesigned the ChemCollective's logo and website, reengineered the backend of the site to use an MVC web framework, and consulted on the interface for their Virtual Lab.</p>

  <p>I began by evaluating the usability and information architecture of the existing website. Working with staff at the ChemCollective and using web log data, I created a new information architecture for the site. The new information architecture made the various resources on the site more discoverable and navigable for new and returning users.</p>

  <p>The old ChemCollective website was a collection of static HTML and CSS pages from over the years. This meant that the hundreds of pages on their site were not standard in terms of layout or styling. To implement the new organzation scheme and design, I moved the website to a database-backed framework. This allowed for the separation of content from code, documentation of resource metadata, and use of consistent page templates.</p>

  <p>Lastly, I consulted on the usability and design of the ChemCollective's flagship Virtual Lab product. I evaluated issues with the current interface, researched competitors', and took inspiration from analogous modern interfaces. In the end, I created low-fidelity mockups of a new interface for the Virtual Lab.</p>
