I created new information
architecture and visual style for the
ChemCollective homepage. The
new homepage is more inviting to
first time visitors to the site, and
allows experienced users to quickly
access resources. I implemented the
design using HTML and CSS.</p>

<p class="description">
On the old ChemCollective website,
all the available activities were listed
on one static page. The new site
uses clickable expanding lists to
allow users to quickly find activities
for a given chemistry topic.</p>

The ChemCollective is a group which provides free online resources for chemistry teachers and students. As part of my summer internship there, I redesigned the ChemCollective logo. The new logo is meant to better communicate the identity of the ChemCollective in terms of both personality and purpose. The new colors and type better reflect the friendly and vibrant personality of the ChemCollective. By incorporating a graduated cylinder (in the wordmark) and the equilibrium symbol, the new logo better communicates the purpose of the ChemCollective-- to provide resources for teaching and learning chemistry. </p>
