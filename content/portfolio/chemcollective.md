description: The ChemCollective provides free online resources for chemistry teachers and students. I redesigned the ChemCollective's logo and website, reengineered the backend of the site to use an MVC web framework, and consulted on the UI for their Virtual Lab.

## Creating a User-Centered Information Architecture

The ChemCollective was founded in 2000 as the IrYdium project. The ChemCollective's primary resource in 2000 was [the Virtual Lab](http://chemcollective.org/vlab/vlab.php) (and it is still). However, over the years, the teaching resources offered by the ChemCollective grew in variety and scope. This growth overwhelmed the original site's design, making it difficult to understand and to navigate, especially for first-time users.

### Effective Communication on the Homepage

Before the redesign project began, I looked at the ChemCollective's homepage to generate some initial ideas on how to improve the site. One issue I noted was the poor visual hierarchy of the page When I spoke to long-time members of the ChemCollective Project, they explained what was import

clear, shouts what the site is and what you can do
The new homepage is more inviting to first time visitors to the site, and allows experienced users to quickly access resources.

### Making Resources More Discoverable

collapsible, two facets for new and old users, detail pages

On the old ChemCollective website, all the available activities were listed on one static page. The new site uses clickable expanding lists to allow users to quickly find activities for a given chemistry topic.

## Graphic Design Refresh

new logo, new brand overall
The new logo is meant to better communicate the identity of the ChemCollective in terms of both personality and purpose. The new colors and type better reflect the friendly and vibrant personality of the ChemCollective. By incorporating a graduated cylinder (in the wordmark) and the equilibrium symbol, the new logo better communicates the purpose of the ChemCollective-- to provide resources for teaching and learning chemistry. 

## Backend: Moving to an MVC Framework

database design, choice of CodeIgniter php framework, front end html/css/js

## Envisioning a New Virtual Lab

The flagship product for the ChemCollective is [the Virtual Lab](http://chemcollective.org/vlab/vlab.php)
