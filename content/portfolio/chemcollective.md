    <p>The new ChemCollective homepage design. Here, the design clarifies the importance of and relationships between information on the page. For example, navigation to access the ChemCollective's resources is centralized in the left hand navigation. On the old site, users would access resources from lists on a few subpages linked to from the homepage.</p>

    <p>Transitioning the ChemCollective site to be database-driven allowed for activities to be automatically organized based on metadata like their type and topic.</p>

    <p>My sketch of a new design for the main work area for the virtual lab. One key change was grouping all of the information about the currently selected chemical in one place, so that it would be simpler to monitor changes.</p>

<div class="project-overview">
  <p>The ChemCollective has provided free online resources for chemistry teachers and students since 2000. The ChemCollective had not updated the design of their logo or website significantly since they were founded, and the original designs for both the logo and website were not done professionally. My internship project was to modernize the design of the ChemCollective's logo and website.</p>

  <p>I began by evaluating the usability and information architecture of the existing site. Working with staff at the ChemCollective, and using web log data, I created a new information architecture for the site. This new information architecture made the variety of resources offered by the ChemCollective more discoverable and navigable for both new and returning users.</p>

  <p>The ChemCollective's older visual identity did not effectively reflect its purpose or personality as an organization. My design work for the ChemCollective (logo, color scheme, typography, layout...) better communicates that the organization is modern, friendly, academic, and science-focused.</p>

  <p>The existing ChemCollective website was primarily static, which meant that there was limited standardization across the hundreds of pages on their site. In order to implement the new structure and design I had created, I transitioned the website to a database-backed framework. This allowed for the separation of content from code, documentation of resource metadata, and use of consistent page templates.</p>

  <p>Lastly, I consulted on the usability and design of the ChemCollective's flagship Virtual Lab product. I evaluated issues with the current interface, researched competitors', and took inspiration from analogous modern interfaces. In the end, I created low-fidelity mockups of a new interface for the Virtual Lab.</p>
