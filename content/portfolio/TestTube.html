		<h3>Ideation: Thoroughly Exploring the Solution Space</h3>
		<h4>The Starting Point</h4>
		<p>My team generated five opportunity statements to spark design ideas based on stakeholder interviews and social media researchOur final design idea was based off these two opportunity statements:
		<ul class="bulleted">
			<li>How can we help tax payers <strong>trust</strong> that their tax money is being spent right?</li>
			<li>How can we <strong>convey meaningful information</strong> to the tax payer about how their money is being spent, on issues that matter to them?</li>
		</ul>
		<h4><em>Hundreds</em> of ideas</h4>
		<img src="/assets/images/testtube/stickies.jpg" alt="Ideas on Sticky Notes on Whiteboard"/>
		<p>The team needed to generate at least one hundred ideas. Research shows that generating ideas individually prior to a group brainstorming session can increase the quantity and variety of ideas produced. Each of us came up with fifty ideas (ten per problem statement) on our own.</p>
		<h5>CrowdSourcing</h4>
		<p>Additionally, we created a survey on Amazon's Mechanical Turk to crowdsource extra ideas. Once we gathered responses on from Mechanical Turk workers, we filtered and rated submissions. Then we met, shared ideas, and put them up on the wall.</p>

		<p>Next, we created an affinity diagram to group similar ideas and uncover larger themes.</p>
