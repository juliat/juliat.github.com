## Summary

As a project in the course “The Information Systems Milieux”, I led a team of six students that came up with a new design for the Information Systems department website. We conducted usability testing with the current site, and based on that, I created a new information architecture for the Carnegie Mellon Information Systems Department website.

I also created a new visual identity for the site to create a more modern and professional impression. My team created a beta version of the site using Wordpress, and I implemented the design as a Wordpress theme. The entire project was completed in about a month.
