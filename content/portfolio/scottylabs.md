I created the logo and website for <a href="http://www.scottylabs.org">ScottyLabs</a>, a technical resource group for students that promotes innovation in practical ways. The site has two intended audiences: students interested in participating in ScottyLabs or attending our events, and potential partners or sponsors.

The site's design is meant to communicate that ScottyLabs is inspiring, technical, innovative, fresh, and rebellious. The design shown here is the result of four design iterations.
