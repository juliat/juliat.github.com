    <p>The paper version of the standard celeration chart that teachers use to track student's academic performance on individual skills. It captures and visualizes data simultaneously, and can be used extremely efficiently by experts. However, the paper format limits possible uses of the data (e.g., other visualizations, comparing to historical data)</p>

    <p>The digital version of the standard celeration chart which we have been developing. Teachers can input data points either by tapping the chart, or by typing in values in the sidebar on the right.</p>

    <p>Currently, teachers keep a binder of charts for each student. In our app, all of a teacher's students are listed in the main navigation. Once a student is selected, a teacher sees a list of all of their charts.</p>

    <p>Teachers use to track skill development, but they also keep a behavior scatterplot chart for their students to track occurrences of  “behaviors of concern.”</p>

    <p>In the digital version of the behavior scatterplot, we prioritized ease of data entry and reading (color-coding each behavior.)</p>

<div class="project-overview">
  <p>Lilypad is a mobile web application for iPad. Its users are teachers at a school and partial hospital in Pittsburgh. The app aids teachers in collecting information about trends in childrens’ behavior and academic performance.</p>
  <p>As a Research Assistant on the project, I have conducted weekly user tests, iteratively prototyped the application at increasing levels of fidelity, and helped to develop the actual application. </p>
