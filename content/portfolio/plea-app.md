description: Lilypad is an iPad app for teachers at a hybrid school and mental hospital in Pittsburgh. The app aids teachers in collecting information about trends in childrens' behavior and performance. As a Research Assistant on the project, I've conducted weekly user tests, iteratively prototyped the app at increasing levels of fidelity, and helped to develop the actual app.
