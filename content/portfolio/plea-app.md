<div class="project-overview">
  <p>Lilypad is an iPad app for teachers at a hybrid school and mental hospital in Pittsburgh. The app aids teachers in collecting information about trends in childrens' behavior and academic performance.</p>

  <p>As a Research Assistant on the project, I've conducted weekly user tests, iteratively prototyped the app at increasing levels of fidelity, and helped to develop the actual app. This project is ongoing.</p>

  <p>Currently, teachers have a binder of charts for each student. These are screenshots of a front-end prototype for a way to navigate between students, and access and create charts in a digital version of this student-tracking system.</p>
