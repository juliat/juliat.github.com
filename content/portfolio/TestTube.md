<p class="description">
Working in a team with two other students in Human-Computer Interaction, I designed and prototyped a web application which allows researchers to make their research more accessible to the general public.</p>

<p class="description">
Our process had five stages: needfinding, ideation, storyboarding and speed dating, pitch, and prototype. Essentially, we started by trying to understand the problem we were trying to solve, then generated ideas, then showed some prototypes of our best ideas to other people to see what they thought, then picked an idea and promoted it, and finally built a high-fidelity prototype for it.

### TestTube
Problems solved:
- needfinding: interviews and online research to find out about transparence and research
- ideation: required 100s of ideas, worked with teammates, affinity diagrammed
- idea selection: difficulty/value tradeoffs, mini market research with speed dating, class voting a la ideo
- pitch: pitching on indiegogo, video production and scripting
- prototyping: design, wizard of oz user testing, front-end development of prototype

		<h3>Ideation</h3>
		<h4>The Starting Point</h4>
		<p>Based on stakeholder interviews and social media research, my team generated five opportunity statements to spark design ideas. Our final design idea was based off these two opportunity statements:
		<ul>
			<li>How can we help tax payers <strong>trust</strong> that their tax money is being spent right?</li>
			<li>How can we <strong>convey meaningful information</strong> to the tax payer about how their money is being spent, on issues that matter to them?</li>
		</ul>
		<h4><em>Hundreds</em> of ideas</h4>
		<p>Since this project was part of a course on the Creative Process, idea generation was a focus. My team was required to generate at least one hundred ideas. Research shows that generating ideas individually before having a group brainstorming session can increase the quantity and variety of ideas produced. So, each group member came up with fifty ideas (ten per problem statement).</p>

		<p>Once we had those ideas, we met, explained them to one another while writing them on sticky notes, then created an affinity diagram of the ideas</p>
