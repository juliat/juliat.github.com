	<h1 class="page-title">Hi! I'm Julia.</h1>

	<p class="about-intro"><strong>I'm currently a student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. </strong>I study <a href="http://http://www.cmu.edu/information-systems">Information Systems</a>, <a href="http://http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, <a href="http://julialt.tumblr.com">Art</a>, and <a href="http://www.design.cmu.edu/">Design</a> </strong>(Double Major, Double Minor, in that order). I like to make things that are useful, usable, and beautiful. I have the smiley in my logo because my default facial expression is a smile.</p>

	<h2>What I Do</h2>

	<p>Technology can do great things&mdash;enabling individuals to create and communicate, and making organizations smarter and more efficient. But for technology to do great things, it has to be designed with two things in mind: the context and the user. In other words, great technology has to be based in the way people work and think. My job is to research, design, and build great technology.</p>

	<h3>Other Ways I Explain What I Do</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I make computers be nice to people.</li>
		<li>I help people use technology in <em>smart</em> ways.</li>
		<li>(tongue-in-cheek) I figure out where to put buttons.</li>
		<li>I design how software should work.</li>
	</ul>
