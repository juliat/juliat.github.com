## My Role

As a Research Assistant on the project, I've conducted weekly user tests, iteratively prototyped the app at increasing levels of fidelity, and helped to develop the actual app. This project is ongoing.

### Navigational UI

Currently, teachers have a binder of charts for each student. These are screenshots of a front-end prototype for a way to navigate between students, and access and create charts in a digital version of this student-tracking system.
